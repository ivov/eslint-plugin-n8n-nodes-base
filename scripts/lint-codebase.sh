# allow `eslint-plugin-local` to `require('../../.eslintplugin')`.
# The flag `--ignore-scripts` bypasses the pnpm block at `preinstall`.

# 1. `index.js` is the entrypoint to this plugin - it is copied during build
# to `/dist/index.js` and references the rules dir at `/dist/lib/rules`.
# This reference is relative to the entrypoint's location after copy.

# `eslint-plugin-local` requires the entrypoint to be named `.eslintplugin.js`
# and located at root, so we copy `index.js` into `.eslintplugin.js`, with
# the rules dir path adjusted relative to the root of the project.

# 3. Run this commit of `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` on the codebase, 
# using the ESLint config `eslintrc.lc.js` (lc -> lint codebase), which
# references `.eslintplugin.js` (all rules) via `eslint-plugin-local`.
# The flag `--no-eslintrc` prevents ESLint from finding and using
# the sibling `.eslintrc.js` that is intended for this plugin.
